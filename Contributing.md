# Contributing guidelines

Welcome to the **good-first-issues** project!. All the new contributors can use this ready reference to kick start their contribution to this project.
Feel free to ask your queries anytime and remember, no contribution is too small :)


# Lets Start!
Follow the steps below and feel free to read from the resources given at the end, in case something is not clear.

## STEP 1:
The very first step is pretty simple, all you have to do is go to the issues option on the navigation bar (refer the image below) and click on it.
You will be redirected to all the issues which are put up by the mentor. 
Click on the issue to read its details. Many tags are also present which tell about the type of issue, its assignment status etc.
Choose the issue of your choice. Drop a comment below the issue to let the mentor know you want to contribute and then you will be assigned the issue :)

## Step 2:

Fork the project to make your own copy of the project. You can make your changes in your own copy and work upon the issues.

Git commands for cloning the project(making your own copy):

    git clone <url of forked version>

To automatically enable other contributors' commits, use 

    git remote add upstream

## Step 3:

Making your own branch.

Git commands:

    git branch <branch name>
    git checkout <branch name>

Now you can go on and make changes in this branch


## Step 4:

Finally you can work on the issue assigned. Debug/create new files or folders as needed 
After you are done,
Use the git commands,

    git add.

## Step 5:

Finally, commit your changes by using the command:

    git commit -m "A message you want to add"

 **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

Also, make your changes available in your forked repository by using the command:

    git push origin <branch name>


## Step 6:

Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
Hurrah! your pull request has been created and will be reviewed by the mentors and merged if its all right!
